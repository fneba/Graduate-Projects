v1 and v2 correspond to just the PKLot dataset and then the PKLot and CarPK datasets combined, respectfully. Note: v2 is messed up, but it was not worth using so it was not fixed.

The _# codes correspond to epoch amounts.

_og is just the PKLot dataset, _baw is black and white, _aug is augmented, and _empty is just empty labels.

The .xlsx file shows a table that we kept for tracking the results of blurring images. The test- folders contain the different datasets used to produce our results found in the spreadsheet.
