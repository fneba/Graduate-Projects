When running this project you need to have terminals for the workers
folder (may need multiple if using multiple workers), for the main
folder, and for the fileserver folder.

To start off, open three terminals, one for each folder and run the
command below:

1. go build .

This will give you the executables necessary to run the system.
After that the system is set up and you can refer to the report
pdf for specific instructions and input combinations to run the
prime counting system.
