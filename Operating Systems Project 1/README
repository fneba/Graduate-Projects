This project is a GoLang multithreaded application to compute the number of prime integers stored in a binary file.
My program takes in three command-line input parameters: pathname, M, N, and C. Here M, N, and C are integers 
(both divisible by 8; units of bytes) and pathname (relative or absolute) is the pathname to an input binary 
datafile (of 64-bit unsigned integers in little-endian byte order). Default values for M, N, and C are 1, 64KB 
and 1KB respectively. 


How to build/run project:

i. From the terminal, change directories into the folder with primes.go

ii. go run primes.go -pathname="path to file" -M=# -N=# -C=#

iii. Example: go run primes.go -pathname="funibaNumbers.dat" -M=1000 

OR

i. From the terminal, change directories into the folder with primes.go

ii. go build primes.go

iii. ./primes -pathname=”path to file” -M=#
